> Short Bio Description 

My name is Christian Mendoza Buenrostro. I am currently working as a Research Lab Coordinator, Data Scientist and Data Science Product Owner at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico. I hold a B.Sc. in Electronics and Electrical Engineering; a M.Sc. in Information Technology Administration; and a Ph.D. in Information Technology and Communications.

During the previous six years, I have been collaborating in multiple research projects in Academia in topics about additive manufacturing, and bioprinting. I have been also awarded with a bi-national collaboration between Mexico-Italia to foster research activities (Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico â€“ University of Pisa, Italy).

Recently, in the last 2 years I have focused my job activities in developing solutions using machine learning / deep learning methods to solve industrial problems. Some of the recent ML / DL projects I have collaborated on are: A computer application to analyze X-Ray images and to provide an indication when a given image presents COVID-19 patterns; Automatic people detection via IP cameras and distance calculation to ensure minimum safe distance in open and closed area environments; and a NLP sentiment analysis webapp.
